    {name: "Ceramics", text: "I began my journey with ceramics in a college class, initially drawn to its tactile nature and creative potential. As I delved deeper, I found a profound appreciation for its ability to teach resilience and acceptance of failure. Ceramics, more than just an art form, became a metaphor for life's challenges, teaching me the value of perseverance and the beauty found in imperfection.", image: ceramics},
    {name: "Hiking", text: "I started hiking at UWC-USA, the international high school I attended in New Mexico. Since my first trip, I have spent in total almost two months hiking and camping. I enjoy being in contact with nature, seeing animals in their natural environment, and the sense of community that can be constructed when hiking in a group. Personally, it is a way to release stress and find joy in the small things around me.", image: hiking},
    {name: "Reading", text: "Growing up, I was always surrounded by books. I started reading when I was four and I have several memories of the time I spent in public libraries, avidly turning pages. My favorite genres are science fiction, drama, and adventure and the most fascinating piece I have ever read is “Story of Your Life,” by Ted Chiang. Reading allows me to develop empathy as well as gain a broader understanding of the world and its inhabitants.", image: reading},
    {name: "Cooking", text: "For a long time, preparing my meals was a source of anxiety and stress. However, after I left the meal plan my college offered, I had no other choice. Slowly, I became comfortable cooking and baking, and now it is one of the activities I enjoy doing the most. I find a lot of pleasure in knowing exactly how my dishes are prepared and seasoned. My favorite dishes to make are chicken pie, lentils with carrots, and any Brazilian food.", image: cooking}
