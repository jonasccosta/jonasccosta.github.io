        <p className='text-light'>üíº Professional Experience </p>
        <p className='text-light'>
        In my previous internship, I had the opportunity to work closely with a startup dedicated to providing support for individuals struggling with substance use issues. As part of this role, I played a pivotal part in assembling and implementing a filterable map of over 450 treatment programs across Minnesota. Leveraging my skills in Google Maps API, EJS, Node.js, and MongoDB, I developed a user-friendly platform that enables individuals to easily find treatment programs tailored to their specific needs and located near their homes. This project exposed me to both the technical challenges of software development and the ethical considerations surrounding the handling of sensitive patient information.
