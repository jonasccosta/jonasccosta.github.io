        My name is Jonas Costa, and I'm currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at Macalester College in Minnesota, where I am majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics and will graduate in May 2023. I am originally from São Sebastião do Paraíso, Brazil.

          I am interested in all processes of design and development of software, but I focus on accessibility and social justice. Most of the time, developers do not think thoroughly about how the technology they create will affect all users. Technology should not cause harm. Instead, people should use it to dismantle prejudices and generate social change. I incorporate this awareness into my work by trying to reduce my biases, using value-sensitive design, and applying ethical lenses.

          On the technical side, I am comfortable designing and developing software in several programming languages and frameworks, such as Java, Python, and JavaScript. I can also use Flutter and Android Studio to build mobile apps. In addition, I enjoy using Figma to design my projects and R and SQL to analyze data.
